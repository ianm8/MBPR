# Multiband Phasing Receiver (MBPR)
This is an HF SSB direct conversion receiver that tunes from 3.5MHz to 30MHz. Quick access to the ham bands is provided. The architecture is based on a quadrature sampling detector and image rejection is implemented with a polyphase RC network. The polyphase RC network provides about 40db opposite sideband suppression using 1% components. This makes is also suitable for listening to AM broadcast stations.
